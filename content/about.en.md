title: About Us
---
We are a group of graduate students who offer **human-computer interaction** assistance to individuals and non-profit organizations in Greater Montreal. When contacted, we assess the situation and one of our members may provide guidance or hands-on support to the extent they are able.

Our goal is to connect early-career HCI practitions to meaningful projects that could benefit from their expertise.

## What are your backgrounds?

Our group includes a handful of Masters and PhD students at McGill University and Polytechnique Montréal working on a variety of different topics. Do not hesitate to contact us with questions outside these areas!

* Accessibility
* Aviation
* Music Education and Technology
* Haptics
* Human-AI Collaboration
* Labour
* User-Centered Design

## Who can submit a request?

We are willing to help individuals working on non-commercial projects and non-profit organizations. Due to our background as graduate students, we have a particular focus on projects driven by our fellow students.

## What kinds of help can you provide?

This depends on the particular problem you are facing, although our assistance will be time and resource limited due to the volunteer nature of our program.
We are willing to:
* give feedback on design and research methodologies;
* conduct brief heuristic evaluations;
* locate HCI-related information relevant to a problem;
* answer specific HCI and UX questions;
* and more!

## What does this cost?

This service is offered free of charge by our volunteers. Because of this, we cannot guarantee that our services will be available.

## I know something about HCI! How can I get involved?
